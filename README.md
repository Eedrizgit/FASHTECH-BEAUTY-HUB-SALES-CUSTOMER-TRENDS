# **Comprehensive Evaluation Fashtech Beauty Hub**

# Overview
Understanding sales performance is crucial for any business, and FashTech Beauty Hub is no exception. Despite steady sales, there is little clarity on which products drive the most revenue, which customer group contributes the most to overall sales, and how purchasing behavior differs based on age and gender. 

# Objectives
This analysis seeks to provide answers to key business questions: How do monthly sales fluctuate over time? Which products generate the most revenue, sell in the highest quantity, and attract the most transactions? Among different age groups, which customers spend the most and engage in more purchases? And finally, between male and female customers, which group contributes more to the company’s revenue? By answering these questions, this project aims to help FashTech Beauty Hub make informed business decisions that optimize sales and improve customer targeting.

# Tools used

Microsoft Excel - data cleaning, pivotcharts, dashboard creation using icons and slicers

# Data

Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Price per Unit, Quantity and Total Amount

The dataset represents sales data from FashTech Beauty Hub, a business operating in the retail industry, specializing in beauty products, electronics, and clothing. Understanding customer preferences and purchasing behavior across these product categories is essential for analyzing sales performance and identifying trends that drive revenue.

# In-Analysis observations

1. May recorded the highest sales generating $53,150.

The store recorded high sales in May, October, and December, making it worth checking whether seasonal demand, promotions, or external factors played a role.

2. Electronics led in revenue, contributing $156,875, making it the most valuable product category.

3. Clothing had the highest sales volume, with 894 units sold.

4. Clothing also had the highest number of transactions, totaling 351, indicating strong demand.

Electronics brought in more revenue, but Clothing sold the highest quantity, which raises the question of whether pricing strategy is affecting product performance.

5. Customers aged 18–27 accounted for the highest total revenue, contributing $104, 915.

The 18–27 age group generated the most revenue, showing that younger customers are more active shoppers. It would be interesting to check if this is because they buy frequently or prefer certain product categories.

6. Female customers outspent males, with a total purchase amounting to $232,840.

With female customers leading in total revenue, it suggests they either shop more often or buy higher-priced items. A closer look at their purchasing pattern might explain

7. Customers aged 48–57 had the highest number of transactions, totalling 226.
